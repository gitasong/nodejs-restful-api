1. The API listens on a PORT and accepts incoming HTTP requests for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and HEAD.
2. The API allows a client to connect, then make a new user, edit that user, and delete the user.
3. The API allows a user to sign in and receive a token, which they can then use for subsequent authenticated requests.
4. The API allows the user to sign out, which invalidates their token.
5. The API allows a signed-in user to use their token to create a new URL "check," and to define what "up" means (e.g. status code 200, anything other than 500, etc.).
6. The API allows a signed-in user to edit or delete any of their "checks" and limits their checks to five in number.
7. In the background, workers perform all the "checks" at the appropriate times, and alert the users when one of their checks change status from "up" to "down" and vice-versa. The checks will run once per minute.
